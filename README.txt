A repository of myself practising UNIX, Bash, Shell Scripting, GitHub, and Python. Taken from open source course materials from Imperial University with permission from Samraat Pawar (s.pawar@imperial.ac.uk). This was completed over two weeks and this repository is simply a collection of practise scripts, and files, in learning and preperation for upcoming interviews.

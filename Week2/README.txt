Continuation of coding practise.
Week2 now focuses primarily on using Python and some basic python writing. A lot of practise line by line in iPython through the terminal. 
All .py files were written in gedit and executed in iPython. When going over and performing a refresher I wrote/edited and ran in Visual Code Studio instead.
